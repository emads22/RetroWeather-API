# RetroWeather API

## Overview
RetroWeather API is a Flask application that delivers historical weather data from CSV files sourced from the `European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D)`. It features endpoints for fetching weather information based on station IDs and dates. Users can also switch to other data sources by updating the files in the static folder.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Renders a web page displaying station data in HTML format. 
- **Weather API Endpoint**: Retrieves temperature data for a specific station and date.
- **One Station All Years Endpoint**: Retrieves all weather data for a specific station.
- **One Station One Year Endpoint**: Retrieves weather data for a specific station and year.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building web applications.
- **numpy**: A library for numerical computations.
- **pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library.

## Enhanced Homepage Styling
The homepage has undergone styling enhancements, resulting in a more visually appealing and engaging design. With updated color schemes, typography, and layout refinements, the homepage now offers a more attractive and enjoyable browsing experience.

## Setup

2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Place your CSV data files in the `assets/data_small` directory. By default, the app expects CSV files from ECA&D.
5. Run the script using `python main.py`.

## Usage
1. Run the script using `python main.py`.
2. Access the home page at the root URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/`) to view station data.
3. Utilize the provided API endpoints to retrieve weather data:
   - `/api/v1/<station>/<date>`: Retrieve temperature data for a specific station and date.
   - `/api/v1/station/<station>`: Retrieve all weather data for a specific station.
   - `/api/v1/station/<station>/<year>`: Retrieve weather data for a specific station and year.
